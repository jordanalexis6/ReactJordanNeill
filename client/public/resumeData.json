    "bio": "I'm an Austin based Full Stack Web Developer leveraging a background in psychology & management to build a more intuitive user experience on the web. Recently earned a certificate in Full Stack Development from the University of Texas at Austin, with newly developed skills in JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and responsive web design. Known as an innovative problem-solver passionate about developing apps, with a focus on mobile-first design and development. With each project, my aim is to best engage my users for an impactful user-experience. I applied aspects of UX and agile development in a recent project where I worked in a team of four to develop a single-page MERN app that helps local business owners track their sales, inventory and attendance at specialty events. Excited to leverage skills in the future as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team in order to build better experiences on the web.",
